Project : Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis (NYC) üè®
Problem Statement

To analyze the New York City Airbnb dataset to extract meaningful insights into the city's dynamic lodging market by discerning factors influencing listing availability, pricing strategies, and host performance.
Key Analysis & Insights

    Data Quality & Cleaning: Extensive cleaning involved handling missing data, converting data types (e.g., last review to datetime), and correcting typographical errors (e.g., 'brookln' to 'Brooklyn'). Outliers in the availability 365 column were also managed.

    Geographical Concentration: Identified that the Manhattan neighborhood group holds the highest number of listings.

    Pricing Structure: Discovered an extremely strong positive correlation (‚âà1.0) between a listing's base price and its service fee, suggesting the fee is directly dependent on the price.

    Host Performance: Found that the number of listings a host owns (calculated host listings count) has a very weak relationship (‚âà0.07) with their properties‚Äô yearly availability.

    Host Quality: Analyzed the relationship between host identity verification and the average review rate.

Deliverables

    Bar charts visualizing neighborhood and property type distribution.

    Regression plots illustrating correlations between pricing and availability factors.

    Data validation checks demonstrating data reliability after cleaning.
